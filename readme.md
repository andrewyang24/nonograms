# Nonograms

## Description

This app uses the model-view-controller design pattern together with the JavaFX UI library to design a complete, functioning GUI implementation of the single-player logic puzzle nonograms. If you've never heard of nonograms before, I highly suggest starting by checking out the nonograms Wikipedia page.
