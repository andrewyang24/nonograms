# Nonograms

## Description

This app uses the model-view-controller design pattern together with the JavaFX UI library to design a complete, functioning GUI implementation of the single-player logic puzzle nonograms. If you've never heard of nonograms before, I highly suggest starting by checking out the nonograms Wikipedia page.

1. Click the vertical "Maven" expansion tab which is on the right side of the IntelliJ window.

2. Expand the "Plugins" folder.

3. Expand the "javafx" folder.

4. Double-click "javafx:run" to run the project.
